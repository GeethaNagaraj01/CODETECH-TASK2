Overview of project

Library Management Clustering System

Project Purpose

The goal of this project is to apply unsupervised learning techniques, such as clustering, to a library management dataset to uncover meaningful patterns and natural groupings. By analyzing data related to books, borrowers, and borrowing records, the project aims to provide insights that can support decision-making in library operations, inventory management, and user services.

Objectives:
Understand and analyze relationships between books, borrowers, and borrowing patterns.
Leverage clustering algorithms to identify trends and segment borrowers and books effectively.
Provide actionable insights for personalized recommendations, inventory optimization, and service improvements.


Key steps:

 1.  Data Integration and Preprocessing:

Combine multiple datasets (Books, Borrowers, and Records) to form a unified dataset.
Preprocess the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

2.  Unsupervised Learning:

 -> K-Means Clustering:
Group data into a predefined number of clusters (e.g., 3) to identify patterns based on numerical and encoded categorical features.
Evaluate performance using the Silhouette Score.
->DBSCAN Clustering:
Perform density-based clustering to discover natural groupings and noise points in the data.
Evaluate clusters using the Davies-Bouldin Index (if multiple clusters exist).

3.  Data Visualization:

Use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce data dimensions for visualization.
Generate scatter plots to depict clustering results from K-Means and DBSCAN.

4.  Export Results:

Save the clustered data with additional labels for future analysis or reporting.

Technologies Used:
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
Data Processing: pandas, numpy
Machine Learning: scikit-learn
Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn

Outcome
A detailed CSV file with clusters assigned to each record.
Visualization plots showing the clustering patterns for both K-Means and DBSCAN algorithms.
Performance metrics like the Silhouette Score and Davies-Bouldin Index to evaluate clustering quality.
Insights into borrower behaviors, book trends, and potential areas for library management improvement.
